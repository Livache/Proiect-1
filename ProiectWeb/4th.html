                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>The fourth generation Ford Mustang was an automobile produced by the American manufacturer Ford for the 1994 through 2004 model years. For 1994 the Ford Mustang underwent its first major redesign in fifteen years. The design, code named "SN-95" by Ford, was based on an updated version of the Fox platform. It featured styling by Bud Magaldi that incorporated some stylistic elements from the classic Mustangs. A convertible returned, but the notchback and hatchback bodystyles used in the earlier Mustangs were not available and now formed into a single fastback coupe bodystyle.
                                
                                Prior to the redesigned Mustang's launch, a two-seater show car was designed by Darrell Behmer and Bud Magali. Called the Mustang Mach III, it was shown at the 1993 North American International Auto Show in Detroit and hinted at what the new production Mustang would look like. The Mach III featured a supercharged 4.6 L DOHC V8 with 450 hp (336 kW; 456 PS). While this engine was not put into production, it hinted to the future use of Ford's Modular V8 in the Mustang, including the eventual use of a supercharged 4.6 L V8.
