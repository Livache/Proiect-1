                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>The sixth generation Ford Mustang is the current iteration of the Mustang pony car manufactured by Ford. The sixth generation was presented at private Ford events on December 5, 2013 and commenced series production at the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant on July 14, 2014. In departure from prior Mustang models, the sixth generation Mustang includes fully independent rear suspension on all models, as well as an optional 2.3L EcoBoost turbocharged and direct injected four cylinder engine. The new Mustang was introduced as a 2015 model year vehicle, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Ford Mustang, which was revealed as a 1965 model year vehicle on April 17, 1964.
                                
                                The sixth generation is also the first Ford Mustang to be marketed and sold globally, and represented the first time that factory right hand drive Mustangs were produced in addition to the left hand drive models. This is part of the "One Ford" business plan, which also applies to the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion/Mondeo, Escape, Kuga, Edge, Ford Transit Connect, and Ford Transit, as well as other models.</p>
